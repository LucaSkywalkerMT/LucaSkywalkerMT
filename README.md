# Who is Luca Ruggier?

I am Luca Ruggier,
I am 26 years old with a Computer Engineering Honours from the University of Malta. I am currently based in Cape Town, South Africa.
With a solid background in wireless communication and microelectronic systems, I strive to continuously expand my knowledge and skills. My passion for electronics, microcontrollers, and single-board computers (SBCs) emerged during high school and has driven me to primarily developing niche electronic systems that cannot be bought "off the shelf." 
I am the Systems Lead and Hardware Developer for Airponix Ltd, an innovative AgriTech company solving food scarcity in regions where grow has previously not been viable.
